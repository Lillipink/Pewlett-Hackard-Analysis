# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# **Overview**
This analysis is to help the HR hiring managers of Pewlett Hackard with determining the amount of retiring employees by their titles and which employees are elegible for a mentorship program. The data found will help Bobby and his employeers fetermine how to best prepare themselves for the future “silver tsunami” that they will face as many of their employees are close to reaching retirement age. The tables made can help identify wich title positions are most in need for new employees and which will be less of a struggle to find new replacements for the retiring populations.

# **Results**
Upon completing this data analysis, I was able to determine which titles are retiting using the Distinct on functions and which employees will be eligible for a mentorship program by combing all previous functions used.
## Retirement Information
- Senior Engineers and Senior Staff are the titles with most amount of retiring employees 
- the mentorship program has 1,549 current eligible employees

# **Summary**
Ultimately the many roles that will need to be filled due to the "silver tsunami" that will impact Pewlett Hackard amount to a total of 72,458 titles. There is not enough retiring personnel to mentor the upcoming generation that is supposed to take over for the "silver tsunami". Below I have included talbes and queries that display how there is not enough retiring employees for the mentorship programs and the sum amount of the retiring roles.
